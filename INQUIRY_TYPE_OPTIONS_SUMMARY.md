3. **Revenue Forecasting**

## Recommendation: Option 2 (6-Choice)

**Why?**

1. **Better Lead Qualification**
   - Know exactly what each lead wants
   - No guessing or reading through free-text messages

2. **Automatic Prioritization**
   - High-value leads (Ready, Group, Corporate) = immediate attention
   - Medium-value (Send Writeup) = automated response + 3-day follow-up
   - Low-value (Browsing) = newsletter automation

3. **Higher Conversion Rate**
   - "Ready to Register" users get instant response
   - Less friction = more registrations

4. **Better Resource Allocation**
   - Sales team focuses on high-priority leads
   - Automated emails handle info requests
   - Don't waste time calling "just browsing" leads

5. **Revenue Optimization**
   - Identify group bookings early (higher revenue)
   - Spot corporate training opportunities (highest revenue)
   - Fast-track "ready to register" (quick wins)

6. **Data-Driven Improvements**
   - Track which types convert best
   - Optimize messaging for each type
   - Measure response time impact

**Cost:** +1 day of development
**Benefit:** Potentially 2-3x conversion rate improvement

---

## User Testing Insights (Recommended)

After implementing, track:

1. **Form Abandonment Rate**
   - Do more options = more confusion?
   - Monitor drop-off at inquiry type field

2. **Distribution of Selections**
   - Which option is most popular?
   - Any option rarely selected? (consider removing)

3. **Time to Select**
   - Do users hesitate?
   - Consider adding tooltips or help text

4. **Conversion by Type**
   - Which inquiry types actually convert?
   - Adjust follow-up strategy accordingly

---

## Final Decision Framework

Choose **Option 1 (2-Choice)** if:
- ✅ You want to launch quickly
- ✅ You prefer simplicity
- ✅ Most inquiries are individual registrations
- ✅ Limited sales team resources

Choose **Option 2 (6-Choice)** if:
- ✅ You want better lead qualification
- ✅ You do group bookings regularly
- ✅ You offer corporate training
- ✅ You have resources for automated emails
- ✅ You want data-driven optimization

**My Recommendation:** Option 2 (6-Choice) - The benefits far outweigh the extra implementation time.
